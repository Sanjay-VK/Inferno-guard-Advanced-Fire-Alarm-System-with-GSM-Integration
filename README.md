# Inferno-guard-Advanced-Fire-Alarm-System-with-GSM-Integration

This project is a smart wireless fire alert system developed using an Arduino Uno, temperature and flame sensors, and a GSM module (SIM800L/SIM900). The system detects fire-related hazards and sends SMS alerts to a predefined phone number, enabling prompt action. It is designed to enhance safety in homes, offices, and educational institutions.

Working Mechanism

Flame and temperature sensors monitor the environment in real-time.

When fire or abnormal heat is detected:

The Arduino processes the sensor signals.

It communicates with the GSM module to send an SMS alert to the registered number.

A buzzer is optionally used for local alerts.

The system can be reset after inspection or recovery.
